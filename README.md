# Howdy there! ðŸ¤ 


This is a collection of cool things and guides that may make you eat your fingers after fully consuming your popcorn reading this documentation.

Sure, it's empty here, but there's more on the way, This is going to be updated with content I find interesting, such as vulnerabilities, Opinions, and anouncements about projects. 
Whenever I start a new project, I list it here, usually explaining what it is, and if it is a public project, such as a Minecraft server, or a hosting group, It'll get it's own page, Elaborating how to be a part of it, What's it about, or literally just anouncing the project if it's private.


These pages are usually updated with "Diaries" such as hardware hacking adventures, tips, and other cool stuff and links / resources I use on a daily basis.

# Who am I? ðŸ¤º


I'm a hardware tinkerer with Electrical and HVAC skills, I break a-da computah and get electrocuted by my own inventions, I mess with electricity and own a whole workshop where I invent and mess with things, I also own an Ender 3 V2 3D Printer, and of course, it has the usual ender behavior of it breaking down every day.

I build PCs as a hobby and earn good cash from it, which is how I'm usually able to afford my *smol* spending habits, I might be addicted or might not be addicted to online shopping, who knows?! that is up to you to decide.
